# Note Taker Challenge - Staying Organized!
  
## Description

Writing notes for class is an essential way to remember and practice what you learned.  The only hurdle here is that not everyone is a great organizer.  Your notes could be all over the place and you won't know where to find them.  Look no further!  This is a simple application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes.

This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.  This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## Installation

No installation is required! This code has been deployed to Render so that you can view it on your own device. To do so, please visit the following link: https://note-taker-challenge.onrender.com/

## Usage

Please refer to the following image showing the functionality of the application. When the page is first loaded, you should see a homepage with the header 'Note Taker', a subheader reading 'Take notes with Express' and a button with the text 'Get Started'.  Additionally, there is a text reading 'Note Taker' in the navigation bar on the top left corner.

Once you click the 'Get Started' button, you will be brought to a page where you can see notes on the left half of the screen and placeholder texts reading 'Note Title' and 'Note Text' on the right half of the screen.

Mousing over the placeholder texts will allow the user to input anything they desire.  Once you fill out both the title and the text, you will see a 'Save Note' button in the top right of the navigation bar.  Please note that the 'Clear Form' button is already there and will appear as soon as you start typing even one character into the form.

Once you click 'Save Note', a new entry will be appended to the list on the left.

You can see the contents if your notes by clicking on any of the notes in the list.  Doing so will also show a 'New Note' button at the top left corner.

You can click the 'New Note' button to clear out the display, which will return you to the screen with the placeholder texts and allow you to enter in a new note.  Additionally, you will also see a red trash can icon next to each of the notes in the list.  Clicking on this trash can will remove the entry for the note that you clicked on.

Our instructor Drew Hoang for introducing us to Express.js this week and opening up a new world of learning for us by showing us how to start connecting the front-end and back-end.  He provides good metaphors for how to do exercises and also makes speed-run videos that are very insightful for providing information and for reviewing class material.

Our TA Kyle Vance for his continued guidance during class and taking the time to explain new concepts. He continues to provide direction for students and is straight to the point in his explainations.
